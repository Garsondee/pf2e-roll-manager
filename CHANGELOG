V1.75

1.) Allow for multiple DCs for different skills
2.) Allow for DCs to be changed even once a roll has been setup.
3.) Generally reworked the underlying code
4.) Add the ability to pickup new inline skill syntax and create a button which sets up a roll.

Potential Issues:

Some actions might not work correctly if they expect a supporting skill but they have multiple potential options/statistics. This is one of the next areas I want to expand next time.
